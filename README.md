## What is cloud computing? 
Cloud computing is the delivery of different services over the internet. It includes aspects such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. [Taken from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cloud-computing.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Cloud%20computing%20is%20the%20delivery%20of%20different%20services%20through%20the,site%20data%20back%2Dup%20solution.)

## Types of cloud computing
There are 4 types of cloud computing, 
1. Private Cloud - Solely dedicated for a group
2. Public Cloud - usually not owned by the end user
3. Hybrid Cloud - mixture of multiple environments
4. Multi-cloud - made up of more than 1 cloud service

## Brief history 
The origins of Cloud computing date back to the 1950-60s where they were shared amongst users and called "dumb terminals". Then, in the 1990s, the internet became accessible which allowed the delievry of resources over the net. SALESFORCE came up with the idea of delievring business applications over the inetrnet. 

Virtualisation, the concept of running multiple VMs on a single devide came popular in early 2000s, Amazon launched Amazon Web Services in 2006. This is where IaaS, Infrastructure as a Service came popular. IaaS provied scalbilty and on-demand resourcing. [Taken from dataversity](https://www.dataversity.net/brief-history-cloud-computing/#)

After the success of AWS, other companies started takin interest, Microsoft Azure and GoogleCloyd Platform being the biggest names. These companies expanded the cloud offerings, which included Platform as a service(PaaS) and Software as a service(SaaS)

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

There are many benfits to cloud computing. Some include:

1. Accessibility: Cloud services enable users to access applications, data, and resources from anywhere with an internet connection.

2. Scalability:  Cloud services provide the ability to scale computing resources up or down according to demand. 

3. Saving on costs: Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront investments in hardware, software, and infrastructure. Instead, users pay for cloud services on a pay-as-you-go basis or through a subscription model.

4. Security: Cloud providers invest heavily in security measures and compliance certifications to protect data and infrastructure. 

5. Reliability and High Availability: Cloud service providers typically offer robust infrastructure and data centers that are designed for high availability.

Quick summary:
Accessibility; anyone with a internet connection can use the applications and resources. 

Scaliability; allows companies to resources up or down according to demand

Costs; No need for upfront costs, pay for what you use via pay-as-you-go

security; cloud providers have some of the best security in  the industry

reliability; providers have robust frameworks designed around high avalability.

### Cloud computing for busineesses

There are many cloud benefits for businesses. A few are:
1. Saving costs: As everything is on the cloyd, there is no need to invest in hardware, licenses and infrastructure, it can all be done via the providers.

2. Scalability: It is very easy to expand your business via the cloud. It's easy to scale up or down depending on what's needed. If your going through a busy period, scale up and then back down when business slows down.

3. Remote working: Cloud allows team memebrs to work from virtually anywhere, they are no longer restricted to working within the building, as the work can be accessed from anywhere.

4. Disaster Recovery: Cloud services offer built-in backup and disaster recovery capabilities. Data is stored in multiple locations, providing redundancy and minimizing the risk of data loss.

5. Security: Cloud providers invest heavily in robust security measures and certifications to protect data and infrastructure. They employ encryption, access controls, and regular security updates to safeguard sensitive information.

## IaaS, PaaS and SaaS

#### IaaS
Infrastructure-as-a-service. Aimed for network architects and It admins, this is where the provider only provides the hardware and the user can do whatever they like with it. It gives the most control to the user. Examples here are: AWS, Stackable, Azure etc

#### Paas
Platform-as-a-Service. This is aimed at developers and engineers, and provides less control compared to IaaS however it focuses more on deploying and devleoping software. The infrastructre behind the deployment is managed by the provider. examples include, Flynn, OpenShift

### SaaS
Software-as-a-service. This provides ready-to-use software for the end user. These users do not need to worry about the infrastructre behind it or maintaining it, the provider does it all. This has the least control.

## Types of cloud computing

### Public Cloud
The public cloud refers to cloud services which are delievered over the internet by providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure. Multiple organizations or individuals share the same infrastructure. The provider is responsible for managing and maintaining the infrastructure, ensuring security, scalability, and availability.

### Private Cloud
Private cloud refers to a cloud infrastructure and services that are dedicated to a single organization. the infrastructure is not shared with other organizations, it gives greater control, security, and customization options.Private clouds are suitable for organizations with specific compliance requirements.

### Hybrid Cloud
Hybrid cloud refers to a combination of public and private cloud environments that are connected and operate as a single. This model allows organisations to take advantage of the scalability, cost-efficiency, and flexibility of the public cloud while maintaining sensitive data or critical workloads in a private cloud.

## Who uses the different clouds?

public clouds: Small to medium-sized business tend to use the public cloud. This is because they  offer cost-effective solutions with minimal upfront investment. There is no need for extensive IT resrources. other examples include: E-commerce and Retail: Online retailers benefit from the elastic resources of the public cloud, allowing them to handle traffic spikes during peak seasons.

Private clouds: Larger companies that hold sensitive data will use private clouds. these can include: 
Financial Institutions: Industries dealing with sensitive customer financial data often opt for private cloud deployments to maintain strict control, compliance, and security. Healthcare and Life Sciences: The healthcare industry, which deals with sensitive patient data, privacy regulations, and complex workflows, often chooses private clouds to ensure compliance and data security.

Hybrid cloud: Enterprises with Variable Workloads: Businesses with fluctuating workloads or seasonal demand can use a hybrid cloud to scale their operations by leveraging the public cloud during peak periods and keeping sensitive or critical workloads in the private cloud.

## Operating expenditure (OpEx) and capital expenditure (CapEx)

Operating Expenditure (OpEx): The ongoing expense incurred by a business in its day-to-day operations.

Capital Expenditure (CapEx): Capital expenditure refers to the expenses incurred for acquiring, upgrading, or improving long-term assets.

Both offer their own advantages and dis-advantages depending on the business. However the cloud offers ways to transition between. One way is a pay-as-you-go service, where the business only pays for the resources they use. It avoids waste and is the best of both situations.
