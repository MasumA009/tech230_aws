Buckets store data as objects. 

![Alt text](s3_image/Screenshot%202023-05-19%20123107.png)

search for s3 buckets on the menu.

buckets should let us do CRUD:
CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete

## Pycharm

open Pycharm as admin, and install awscli
```
pip install awscli
```
we can check what packages are installed:

type:
```
aws configure
```
this will ask for our key enter it.
`region: eu-west-1 `.

`output format: json`

check if we are inside the bucket by checking what the buckets are called:
```
aws s3 ls
```
It results in a list of the s3 buckets.

## Make bucket

```
aws s3 mb s3://tech230-masum-bucket --region eu-west-1
```
results in:

remember we can check the list of buckets:
```
aws s3 ls
```
send/upload file to a bucket:
```
aws s3 cp sampletext.txt s3://tech230-masum-bucket
```
We can verify its been sent by manually checking on aws:

## Read bucket

read contents of bucket
```
aws s3 sync s3://tech230-masum-bucket s3_downloads
```
We can then see that the file has been downloaded through the file explorer.

## Delete bucket
to delete a bucket we need to make sure the bucket is empty.

### remove file from bucket
```
aws s3 rm s3://tech230-masum-bucket/sampletext.txt
```
as seen:

### Delete everything from a bucket:
```
aws s3 rm s3://tech230-masum-bucket --recursive 
```
### Delete entire bucket
```
aws s3 rb s3://tech230-masum-bucket 
```

use `aws s3 ls` to check if its been deleted.


## install boto3
```
pip install boto3
```

Now, were going to do what we did early, but in a python file.

## Accessing s3

#### how to use "aws s3 ls" via python file

#connect to s3

this results in a listings of the buckets:

full file:
```
import boto3

# connect to s3
s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

# list buckets
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)
```

## Creating a s3 bucket
```
import boto3

# connecting to s3
s3 = boto3.client("s3")

# create s3 bucket
bucket_name = s3.create_bucket(Bucket = "tech230-masum-boto", CreateBucketConfiguration={"LocationConstraint": "eu-west-1"})

# print the names
print(bucket_name)
```

## Upload to a s3 bucket
```
import boto3

# connect to s3
s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

# opens the file we want to send, and stores it in a variable
data = open("sampletext.txt", "rb")

# specify the bucket were sending to:
# ".put_object" names the file and sends the contents
s3.Bucket("tech230-masum-boto").put_object(Key = "sampletext.txt", Body = data)

# the proof of this working can be seen on aws
```

## download from a s3 bucket
import boto3

#connect to s3
s3 = boto3.client("s3")

#download from s3
s3.download_file("tech230-masum-boto", "sampletext.txt", "sampletext1.txt")

print(s3.download_file)


## delete from a s3 bucket
```
import boto3

#connect to s3
s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

# delete a file in a particular bucket
s3.Object("tech230-masum-boto", "sampletext.txt").delete()
```

## delete a s3 bucket
```
import boto3

#connect to s3

s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

bucket = s3.Bucket("tech230-masum-boto")
response = bucket.delete()

print(response)
```
